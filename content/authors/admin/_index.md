I am a PhD student at the Faculty of Agricultural Technology in KMITL. My research interests include agricultural development and economics. I love doing doing data visualization and learning statistical programming using R.

I worked as a research assistant in the Visayas State University for two years. Afterward, I was employed as an instructor at the Department of Business and Management. My teaching experiences includes managerial economics, financial management for agrobusiness enterprises, and production economics.
